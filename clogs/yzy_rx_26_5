ren xiang: Pretty cool stuff
zheng yew: whats he say about the language then
ren xiang: Russian is romantic
zheng yew: its more complicated than english in some ways
ren xiang: The expression is unlike other languages
zheng yew: yeah thats true
zheng yew: even the tone of voice is different
ren xiang: Also the russian characters are pretty funky
zheng yew: like if you were to ask a question in english vs russian
ren xiang: I wonder how russian language roots back
zheng yew: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vpwDqK5d304
zheng yew: im not very sure either
zheng yew: but its got a lot of latinized words
ren xiang: How do you learn a new language
zheng yew: so if you learn the alphabet alone sometimes you can sorta guess

esp more modern words ofc
zheng yew: i tend to dive into grammar first haha
zheng yew: even if i cant make a sentence with its vocabulary
ren xiang: Do you listen to the podcast in the new language?
zheng yew: not really
zheng yew: i dont really learn that well from the usual submerge-yourself-and-intuit kind of advice that people give
zheng yew: some people do though
zheng yew: like how people here pick up dialects from their grandparents
zheng yew: im a bit bookish
ren xiang: How to keep the good at it without practice
zheng yew: its like reading documentation i guess lol
zheng yew: oh you do have to practice
ren xiang: Like talking to people fluent in it
zheng yew: generally i guess if youre really interested you could try writing in it
zheng yew: anything really
zheng yew: its a bit like trying a new programming languages yknow
zheng yew: hello world and all that
ren xiang: Wow
zheng yew: but yeah if you wanna go far with it you probably should join some kind of community
ren xiang: I dont think you can write programming language in Russian
zheng yew: hahaha

i read somewhere the chinese have a version of C++ in chinese
zheng yew: not sure if its true
ren xiang: Dont think so
ren xiang: Documentation prob
zheng yew: yeah true
zheng yew: but yeah in general like for japanese once you are somewhat fluent in it

i think anime and doraemon are the right places to go -w-
zheng yew: whatever catches your interest in the first place
ren xiang: Yup
ren xiang: Sry i gtg
zheng yew: i did some japanese too
zheng yew: oh sure
ren xiang: Nice talking you
zheng yew: nice talking to you haha
ren xiang: I thought of one more thing, the way people text can be a new language?
ren xiang: Unique language to every person
zheng yew: oh yeah
zheng yew: we all have idiosyncracies
zheng yew: linguists can study individuals and tell them apart
ren xiang: Its like trying to cram emotions in to text
ren xiang: Gives interesting results
zheng yew: true
zheng yew: i wonder what texting will be like in the future lol
ren xiang: Language evolves with us
zheng yew: once people have really got used to it for generations
ren xiang: I think it will go away
ren xiang: It still feels unnatural
zheng yew: what would replace it then
ren xiang: Teleportation
ren xiang: Idk
ren xiang: Hopeful tho
zheng yew: oh that would be cool lol
zheng yew: a bit scary though
ren xiang: Unless brain to machine interface are good
zheng yew: the conundrum of are you really the same person if you were destroyed and created etc
ren xiang: Well
ren xiang: Like life
